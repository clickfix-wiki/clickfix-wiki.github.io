# About ClickFix Wiki

## Mission

ClickFix Wiki is a comprehensive database documenting social engineering techniques and Indicators of ClickFix (IoCF). Our mission is to provide educational resources for security professionals, researchers, and organizations to better understand and defend against social engineering attacks.

## What We Document

We focus on documenting:

- **Social Engineering Lures**: Common pretexts and techniques used by attackers
- **System Tools**: How legitimate system tools can be misused
- **Capabilities**: UAC bypass, MOTW clearing, file system access, etc.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: How to defend against these techniques

## Educational Purpose

This wiki serves **strictly educational purposes**:

- ✅ **Security Research**: Understanding attack vectors
